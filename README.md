# AI-Travel-Planner
Field of the Invention: 
The invention is an AI-enabled travel planner that helps users organize trips based on their likes, budget, time limits, and real-time information. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest the best routes, lodging, and activities, ensuring a personalized travel experience. It connects with various APIs like airlines, hotels, weather, public transport, and emergency services for a complete travel planning solution. 
Background of the Invention: 
Traditional travel planning takes a lot of time and involves manual research and booking on different platforms, leading to inefficiency and decision fatigue. While some apps give recommendations, they do not adjust in real-time or provide personalized AI insights. Problems like travel delays, price changes, and itinerary management increase stress for travellers, highlighting the need for an automated AI solution. Current available solutions do not offer a fully integrated AI platform that can dynamically respond to issues such as weather changes, flight disruptions, or safety warnings.
